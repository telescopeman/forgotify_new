# "Forgotify New" (working title)

Package with tools for music discovery on Spotify.

- *random_song.py*: Module that contains functions to make requests to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to retrieve pseudo-random obscure songs. The default popularity threshold is 1, but you can enter your own via the command line, as well as a specific genre if wanted.
- *genres.json*: List containing every valid Spotify genre retrieved from [Everynoise.com](http://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi?scope=all&vector=popularity).
